        <p> This specimen started out as a 2010 Jet Stream Breezer hardtail mountain bike from Craigslist.
          After a fair amount of legwork and cash spent, it is a powerful rear hub motor ebike.
          Features include a modified gearing ratio thanks to a 52 tooth front chainring and
          a small 12 tooth rear freewheel for high speed pedaling, a bring headlight, horn,
          center stand, tons of storage space,
          suspension seat post, phone mount, and rear view mirror for riding with traffic. It is equipped with a large
          52 volt, 28 amp-hour battery and a 750 watt hub motor.
          This makes the bike great for any short trip, grocery store included. It will hold more than you'd think.

    <p> Currently 1500+ miles on this bike.
      Brake pads needed 1 change, and same with the rear tire. They wear more quickly than an acoustic bike because it goes faster. </p>

      <h1> Hardtail 26 Complete Rebuild </h1>
          <img src="img/small_ebike_unbuilt.jpg">
        </div>
        <p> This bike originally had a controller integrated into the hub motor but ultimately had a mechanical defect
          that had to be replaced, and per the direction of the warranty policy, all parts from the kit
          needed to be returned. Therefore, the bike was completely stripped down and
          rebuilt as you see in these photos. There were bike parts strewn about my entire apartment.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <img src="img/new_tire.jpg" style="float: left;">
        </div>

          <p> These new tires make for a good insurance policy
            against flats and give a smoother, quieter ride than the old, brittle rubber. I would much rather spend the
            money up front if it lowers the chance of needing to replace a flat since there are extra steps involved if
            the flat is on the hub motor wheel. </p>

          <p> ...And here is our "final" result. These projects are always open to improvements, changes, and experiments.
            Since this photo was taken,
            a pedal assist sensor has been added per the request of the main user. </p>
