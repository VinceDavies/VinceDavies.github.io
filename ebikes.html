      <h1> Hardtail 29er </h1>
        <p> This specimen started out as a 2010 Jet Stream Breezer hardtail mountain bike from Craigslist.
          After a fair amount of legwork and cash spent it is a powerful rear hub motor ebike.
          Features include a modified gearing ratio thanks to a 52 tooth front chainring and
          a small 12 tooth rear freewheel for high speed pedaling, a bring headlight, horn, center stand, tons of storage space,
          suspension seat post, phone mount, and rear view mirror for riding with traffic.
          This makes the bike great for knocking any short trip out with ease.
        <br>
        Main Specs: <br>
        52 volt 28 amp-hour battery <br>
        750 watt hub motor <br>
        </p>

      <h1> Hardtail 26 rebuild </h1>
        <p> This bike originally had a controller integrated into the hub motor but ultimately had a mechanical defect
          that had to be replaced, and per the direction of the warranty policy, all parts from the kit
          needed to be returned. Therefore, the bike was completely stripped down and
          rebuilt as you see in these photos. </p>
          <img src="img/small_ebike_unbuilt.jpg">
          <p> I wanted to illustrate the chaos that ensued from this rebuild. </p>
          <img src="img/new_tire.jpg" style="float: left;">
          <p> These new tires make for a good insurance policy
            against flats and give a smoother quieter ride than the old brittle rubber. </p>
          <img src="img/small_ebike_finished.jpg" style="float: left;">
          <p> This is the result of the bike being about 95% finished. Since this photo was taken,
            a pedal assist sensor has been added per the request of the main user. </p>
